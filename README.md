# hello-world
My first repository


Hi everyone! My name is Julian Caleb Simandjuntak. The time I am making this, I am just a high school student and going to graduate next year.
This is my first repo, "hello world", the start of every programmers journey.
I am looking forward to contribute to as many people as I can!
